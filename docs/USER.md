##0. Prerequisites
1. Make sure you are in your Spanish teacher's Google Classroom class.
2. Make sure you are using a device with a large screen (ie. not a phone).
3. Make sure you are using a web browser that is not Internet Explorer 8 or older. If you have to use an old browser, the site may still work, but no support will be provided. Optimally, you will be using Google Chrome.

##1. Using the Website
1. Go to [phs-spanishreview.appspot.com](phs-spanishreview.appspot.com).
2. If asked, sign in to your mcpsmd.net account. __DO NOT__ use your personal Google account - it will not work. If you accidentally sign in using that account, a dialog box will show up informing you of this. Simply close the dialog box to sign out, and sign back in using your mcpsmd.net account.
3. A dialog box should show up, showing you information about what work you have completed. At the bottom of this dialog box, there will be two buttons - one for a blank worksheet and one for a regular worksheet. Click one to start working.
4. You will see a window with two panes - one with a mostly empty table, and the other with a long list of gray boxes. Drag each gray box into its corresponding table cell.
5. If you get a worksheet and before submitting, get another worksheet, the first worksheet will not be graded properly. To avoid this, __do not__ ask for a worksheet if you are not going to complete it. 
5. When you are done, click the "Submit" button on the top bar. If the worksheet is filled out, you should be redirected to the home page. You will see your score and overall worksheets completed. If the worksheet is not filled out, you will receive a dialog box saying that the worksheet is not completed. In this case, fill out the worksheet by dragging each gray box into its corresponding table cell and finish the worksheet.
6. If you receive an error and you think you did nothing wrong, report it to your Spanish teacher.
